Our client is an Insurance company that has provided Health Insurance to its customers now they need your help in building a model to predict whether the policyholders (customers) from past year will also be interested in Vehicle Insurance provided by the company. An insurance policy is an arrangement by which a company undertakes to provide a guarantee of compensation for specified loss, damage, illness, or death in return for the payment of a specified premium. A premium is a sum of money that the customer needs to pay regularly to an insurance company for this guarantee. For example, you may pay a premium of Rs. 5000 each year for a health insurance cover of Rs. 200,000/- so that if, God forbid, you fall ill and need to be hospitalised in that year, the insurance provider company will bear the cost of hospitalisation etc. for upto Rs. 200,000. Now if you are wondering how can company bear such high hospitalisation cost when it charges a premium of only Rs. 5000/-, that is where the concept of probabilities comes in picture. For example, like you, there may be 100 customers who would be paying a premium of Rs. 5000 every year, but only a few of them (say 2-3) would get hospitalised that year and not everyone. This way everyone shares the risk of everyone else.

Just like medical insurance, there is vehicle insurance where every year customer needs to pay a premium of certain amount to insurance provider company so that in case of unfortunate accident by the vehicle, the insurance provider company will provide a compensation (called ‘sum assured’) to the customer.

Building a model to predict whether a customer would be interested in Vehicle Insurance is extremely helpful for the company because it can then accordingly plan its communication strategy to reach out to those customers and optimise its business model and revenue.

Now, in order to predict, whether the customer would be interested in Vehicle insurance, you have information about demographics (gender, age, region code type), Vehicles (Vehicle Age, Damage), Policy (Premium, sourcing channel) etc.

### Problem Statement

Building a predictive model to determine customer interest in vehicle insurance can significantly benefit a company by enabling it to:

1. Targeted Marketing: Identify potential customers who are more likely to purchase vehicle insurance, allowing for focused marketing efforts and personalized communication strategies.
2. Resource Optimization: Allocate resources efficiently by concentrating efforts on high-probability customers, reducing wasted marketing spend on unlikely leads.
3. Customer Insights: Gain deeper insights into customer preferences and behavior, aiding in the development of tailored insurance products that meet specific customer needs.
4. Revenue Maximization: Increase sales conversions by engaging with the right customers, thereby boosting overall revenue and profitability.
5. Customer Retention: Improve customer retention rates by understanding and addressing the needs and concerns of current policyholders, potentially offering them additional products or services.
6. Competitive Advantage: Stay ahead of competitors by leveraging data-driven strategies to anticipate customer needs and market trends.

### Steps :
1. Data Collection: Gather relevant data on customer demographics, past purchase behavior, interactions with the company, vehicle details, and any other pertinent information.
2. Data Preprocessing: Clean and preprocess the data to handle missing values, outliers, and ensure consistency. This might include data normalization, encoding categorical variables, and feature engineering.
3. Feature Selection: Identify and select the most relevant features that influence customer interest in vehicle insurance. This can involve statistical tests, correlation analysis, and domain expertise.
4. Model Building: Choose appropriate machine learning algorithms (e.g., logistic regression, decision trees, random forests, gradient boosting machines) to train the model. Split the data into training and testing sets to evaluate the model's performance.
5. Model Evaluation: Assess the model using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC to ensure it performs well in predicting customer interest.
6. Model Deployment: Implement the model into the company's systems to start making predictions on new customer data. This might involve setting up an API or integrating the model into the CRM or marketing platforms.
7. Monitoring and Maintenance: Continuously monitor the model's performance and update it with new data to maintain its accuracy and relevance over time.
